Hello Git and GitHub
Description:  This is an educational project prompted through codeacademy to
start up git hub for the first time and make my first repository via the
command line and github website

I have now updated the local directory user.email to kabohn90@gmai.com to match
the github profile.  This update and future should reflect this email for just
this folder/directory.

I am now telling the computer exactly, what it can do...with a lifetime supply
of chocolate...

Your turning violet, Violet.
